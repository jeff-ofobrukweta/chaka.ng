                Investors should consider the investment objectives and unique risk profile of
                Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) carefully before investing. ETFs are subject to risks
                similar to those of other diversified portfolios. Leveraged and Inverse ETFs may not
                be suitable for all investors and may increase exposure to volatility through the
                use of leverage, short sales of securities, derivatives and other complex investment
                strategies. Although ETFs are designed to provide investment results that generally
                correspond to the performance of their respective underlying indices, they may not
                be able to exactly replicate the performance of the indices because of expenses and
                other factors.
            </p>

            <p>
                Carefully consider your investment objectives, the risks, charges and expenses
                involved in investing in the Nigerian and International stock markets. Itâ€™s
                important to note that the same way profits can be made in the markets, losses can
                also be made as well. In the light of the risks involved, you should undertake
                transactions only if you understand the nature of the relationship into which you
                are entering and the extent of your exposure to risk. You must know and appreciate
                that trading in Equity shares or other instruments traded on the Stock Exchanges,
                which have varying element of risk, is generally not an appropriate avenue for
                someone of limited resources/limited investment and/or trading experience and low
                risk tolerance. You should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is
                suitable for you in the light of your financial condition.

                All investments involve risk and the past performance of a security, or financial
                product does not guarantee future results or returns. Keep in mind that while
                diversification may help spread risk it does not assure a profit, or protect against
                loss, in a down market. There is always the potential of losing money when you
                invest in securities, or other financial products. Investors should consider their
                investment objectives and risks carefully before investing. Investors should be
                aware that system response, execution price, speed, liquidity, market data, and
                account access times are affected by many factors, including market volatility, size
                and type of order, market conditions, system performance, and other factors. As a
                business we don't give stock tips, recommendations or provide any advisory services.
